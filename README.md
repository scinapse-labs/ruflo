# Ruflo

**Multi-agent AI orchestration for Claude Code**

</div>

Deploy 16 specialized agent roles + custom types in coordinated swarms with self-learning capabilities, fault-tolerant consensus, and enterprise-grade security.

### Why Ruflo?

Claude Flow is now Ruflo -- named by Ruv, who loves Rust, flow states, and building things that feel inevitable. The "Ru" is the Ruv. The "flo" is the flow. Underneath, WASM kernels written in Rust power the policy engine, embeddings, and proof system. 6,000+ commits later, this is v3.5.

### Getting into the Flow

Ruflo is a comprehensive AI agent orchestration framework that transforms Claude Code into a powerful multi-agent development platform. It enables teams to deploy, coordinate, and optimize specialized AI agents working together on complex software engineering tasks.

```
Self-Learning / Self-Optimizing Agent Architecture

User --> Ruflo (CLI/MCP) --> Router --> Swarm --> Agents --> Memory --> LLM Providers
                          ^                           |
                          +---- Learning Loop <-------+
```

> **New to Ruflo?** You don't need to learn 314 MCP tools or 26 CLI commands. After `init`, just use Claude Code normally -- the hooks system automatically routes tasks, learns from successful patterns, and coordinates agents in the background.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code Plugin (Recommended)

Install Ruflo as a native Claude Code plugin -- adds skills, commands, agents, and MCP tools directly:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ruvnet/ruflo

# Install core + any plugins you need
/plugin install ruflo-core@ruflo
/plugin install ruflo-swarm@ruflo
/plugin install ruflo-autopilot@ruflo
```
